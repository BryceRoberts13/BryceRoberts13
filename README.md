# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Bryce Roberts!  

I'm a math student at MIT, expanding my skill set to include software development and AI deployment. I have a strong foundation in mathematical theory and am working on applying it to real-world problems.  

## ðŸ”§ What I'm Learning  
- **Python** for development and AI
- **C++** 

## ðŸŒ¿ Outside of Tech  
I like **swimming, hiking, bouldering,** and **surfing**â€”basically anything outdoors.
